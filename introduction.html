        <h2 id="green">Abstractions</h2>
        <p id="whiteP">
            When people communicate, they often use abstract words like "technology", "growing" and "disruption".
        </p>
        <p id="whiteP">
            Those words may sound like they mean something specific, but there are a lot of different ways to interpret
            them.
        </p>
        <p>
            Does "technology" refer to phones?
            Fiber-optic cables?
            Quantum computers?
            Or something else entirely?
        </p>
        <p>
            You have no way of knowing... until you ask them.

        <h2 id="green">Illusion of Understanding</h2>

        <p id="whiteP">
            One of the major roadblocks to communication is the illusion of understanding.
            That happens when two people are talking about technology, and one is thinking about fiber-optic cables,
            while
            the other is thinking of quantum computers.
        </p>
        <p id="whiteP">
            Or when two people are talking about that there needs to be a disruption in education,
            but one is thinking about giving students more freedom, while the other is thinking about how to train his
            dog to sit using carrots.
        </p>
        <p>
            Both people are using the same words, but they derive a completely different meaning from those words.
            And they won't find out until they ask specifying questions.
        </p>
        <p id="whiteP">
            And you can learn to do that using this game.
        </p>
        <p id="whiteP">
            (Most of the time the misunderstandings are less obvious than in the examples above.)
