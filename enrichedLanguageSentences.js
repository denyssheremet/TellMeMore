He regretting drinking a whole bottle of rum and declaring his love to the maiden the night before
The sun set on the village as the market closed up
With the storm brewing, she tried to make it to the harbour in time
He slammed the book on the desk and looked at the class
She laughed and looked away
They went to the club and danced their feet off for three hours
The old man got up from his chair and fetched a bowl of chips
He grabbed the kid and swam to the surface
The building was about to collapse and one woman was still in there scrambling for her stuff
He walked out of the door, closed it behind him and started to cry
This was his first time in a baseball match and he missed his first catch, dropping the ball on the floor
The arrow missed the mark and landed in a passing chicken
I packed my bag and quickly left the dormitory
